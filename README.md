# pitch_atbat_data
This code scrapes the mlbam site and parse the xml pitch, atbat, runner, and action files using the pitchRx library.  
I have downloaded the data from the 2015-2016 seasons to score each player on runs created by adding for each atbat,
the difference between the end and start expected runs states.
